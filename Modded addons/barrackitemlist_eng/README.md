Modified barrackitemlist_eng by writ312 for iToS patch 166969_001001.ipf


Likely bug:
Addon icon may disappear for 1 map when the game adds in a new icon in the middle of a map (joining a guild, class change to necromancer, etc.)


Patch notes
v1.0.0.2
Patched icon disappearing if language is changed, but addon requires map change to recover
