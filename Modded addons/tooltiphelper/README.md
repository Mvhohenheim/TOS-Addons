This is a patched version of Xanaxiel's tooltip helper addon for iToS patch 175073_001001.ipf

Uses xmlSimple from Tree of Savior Magnum Opus Puzzles by Excrulon, which is a modified version of the original created by Alexander Makeev


Problems:
---
Items which have a lot of recipes, like hook and hallowventer hand bones, still lags

Text positioning may be off


Patch notes
---
### v2.1.4.4

Speed improvements

Used the wrong magnum opus version as the default in v2.1.4.3

Magnum opus transmutes shows only 1 row and column more than necessary

Item level (no longer used) changed to item star

New colour for legendary grade items

Added exchange shop recipes

Fixed cube price display

Added item drop display

Switched integration from marktioneer to marktioneerex

Equipment gem display on long frames positioned to be more visible

### v2.1.4.3

You can now paste the latest recipe_puzzle.xml file in /addon/tooltiphelper to update the magnum opus recipe list

If the file is not there, this addon will revert to using the old recipe list on iToS

### v2.1.4.2

Hopefully reduces lag when hovering over items
