This is a modified version of Excrulon's statviewer addon

To toggle the statviewer frame between visible and invisible, type "/statviewer" in chat

The "frameitems.json" file in the addon folder can also be edited to customise what is shown

Bug: Addon loading error message not displayed in chat since this addon is loaded first.
